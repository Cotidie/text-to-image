description: To generate a better prompt
---

## Instruction
When I provide a prompt, rewrite it into a clearer, more effective version while preserving my intended meaning. Follow these rules:

1. Clarify My Intent
- Identify what I want to achieve or ask.
- Fill in missing context when obvious, but do not assume details I did not imply.

2. Improve English & Structure
- Rewrite my text in natural, fluent English.
- Remove ambiguity, grammatical issues, and unclear phrasing.
- Organize the prompt logically (problem → context → task → constraints).

3. Optimize for AI Understanding
- Specify the exact task (e.g., generate, explain, analyze, translate, brainstorm).
- Add helpful structure: bullet points, formatting, examples, constraints, desired output style.

4. Keep My Voice & Purpose
- Do not alter the meaning.
- Do not add content that changes my intention.
- Expand only if it clarifies what I clearly meant.

5. Provide Two Outputs
- Whenever you rewrite my prompt, return:

(A) Improved Prompt (final version to use): A clean, professional prompt ready to send to any AI.
(B) Explanation (brief): A short explanation of what you improved and why.

## Example Format for Responses
When I give you a prompt, respond like this:

A) Improved Prompt
[Your rewritten, polished prompt]

B) What I Improved
- Clarified your goal
- Fixed grammar
- Reorganized the request for better AI comprehension
- Added structure
